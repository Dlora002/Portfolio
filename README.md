  - Performed data cleaning in R, addressing formatting issues and removing unnecessary columns to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  - Visualized the CPI time series from 2020 to 2024, identifying trends and fluctuations, including the impact of COVID-19 on CPI in 2021.
  - Applied decomposition techniques (X-11, Classical, and STL Decomposition) to isolate trends and seasonal patterns.
  - Implemented various forecasting models, including Mean, Naïve, Seasonal Naïve, and STL Decomposition Models.
  - Achieved the best performance with the Naïve Drift Model, providing accurate forecasts with the lowest RMSE and MAE values.
  - Used cross-validation to improve model accuracy and reliability.
  - Presented forecasting results and insights to stakeholders, highlighting key findings and the economic implications of CPI trends.

## 2. Data Cleaning Airbnb
- **Description**: The project involved intensive data cleaning steps, addressing missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering, and data transformation.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Cleaned data, handled missing values, and calculated average prices by neighborhood.
